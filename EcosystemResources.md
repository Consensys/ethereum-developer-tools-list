# Ecosystem Resources
A guide to the available dapps, services, writings, and knowledge bases for learning and understanding the Ethereum ecosystem.

This resource is meant to be focused on ecosystem development, but the repo also includes:
* [Ethereum Developer Tools List](README.md)

## Contributions are welcome!

Feel free to submit a pull request, with anything from small fixes to tools you'd like to add. If adding a new tool, **please add a brief description** that you think new developers would understand.

Many thanks to the 20+ contributors including [@corbpage](https://twitter.com/corbpage) of Meridio for the idea, [@pakaplace](https://twitter.com/Parker_Place) for expanding and curating, and @jpantunes for restructuring the list in a more logical way.
