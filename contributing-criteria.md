# Contribution Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of the ethereum-developer-tools-list is to direct developers to useful tools, educational resources, and platforms for developing on Ethereum. 

As the volume of pull requests has increased and some of the PR's have included tools with little testing, an open discussion is needed to develop a standard for contributions.

While it may be useful for new projects to gain attention by adding themselves, it may increase the amount of time it takes new developers to find reliable tools that meet their needs. Another goal is to prevent double-work by directing developers to needed tools they can contribute to. 

## Format
Please ensure that your pull request includes a useful title, not just "Update readme.md"
