# Ethereum Developer Tools List
A guide to available tools, components, patterns, and platforms for developing applications on Ethereum.

Creation of this list was spurred by product managers at ConsenSys who saw a need for better sharing of tools, development patterns, and components amongst both new and experienced blockchain developers.

This resource is meant to be focused on developer tools, but the repo also includes:
* [Ethereum Ecosystem Resources](EcosystemResources.md) for useful DApps, educational resources, wallets, and services.

## Contributions are welcome!

Feel free to submit a pull request, with anything from small fixes to tools you'd like to add (or remove!). If adding a new tool, **please add a brief description** that you think new developers would understand.

Many thanks to the ~100 contributors including [@corbpage](https://twitter.com/corbpage) and [@pakaplace](https://twitter.com/Parker_Place) of [Meridio](https://www.meridio.co/) for curating, and @jpantunes for restructuring the list in a more logical way.
* Projects that do not have a working product will not be added.
* Projects that are deprecated or no longer maintained will be removed.
* Projects that are paid/restricted services without open source code or developer reviews will be further vetted.

#### Patterns & Best Practices

##### Patterns for Smart Contract Development
* [Dappsys: Safe, simple, and flexible Ethereum contract building blocks](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys)
    * has solutions for common problems in Ethereum/Solidity, eg.
        * [Whitelisting](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nexusdev/dapp-a-day-11-whitelist-boring)
        * [Upgradable ERC20-Token](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nikolai/dapp-a-day-6-upgradeable-tokens)
        * [ERC20-Token-Vault](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nexusdev/dapp-a-day-18-erc20-token-vault)
        * [Authentication (RBAC)](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nikolai/dapp-a-day-4-access-control-via-auth)
        * [...several more...](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys)
    * provides building blocks for the [MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc) or [The TAO](https://github.com/ryepdx/the-tao)
    * should be consulted before creating own, untested, solutions
    * usage is described in [Dapp-a-day 1-10](https://steemit.com/@nikolai) and [Dapp-a-day 11-25](https://steemit.com/@nexusdev)
* [OpenZeppelin Contracts: An open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
    * Likely the most widely-used libraries and smart contracts
    * Similar to Dappsys, more integrated into Truffle framework
    * [Blog about Best Practices with Security Audits](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/)
* [Advanced Workshop with Assembly](https://github.com/androlo/solidity-workshop)
* [Simpler Ethereum Multisig](https://medium.com/@ChrisLundkvist/exploring-simpler-ethereum-multisig-contracts-b71020c19037) - especially section _Benefits_
* [CryptoFin Solidity Auditing Checklist](https://github.com/cryptofinlabs/audit-checklist) - A checklist of common findings, and issues to watch out for when auditing a contract for a mainnet launch.
* [aragonOS: A smart contract framework for building DAOs, Dapps and protocols](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-intro.html)
    * Upgradeability: Smart contracts can be upgraded to a newer version
    * Permission control: By using the `auth` and `authP` modifiers, you can protect functionality so only other apps or entities can access it
    * Forwarders: aragonOS apps can send their intent to perform an action to other apps, so that intent is forwarded if a set of requirements are met
* [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)
    * Organize contracts so they share the same contract storage and Ethereum address.
    * Solves the 24KB max contract size limit.
    * Upgrade diamonds by adding/replacing/removing any number of functions in a single transaction.
    * Upgrades are transparent by recording them with a standard event.
    * Get information about a diamond with events and/or four standard functions.
* [Clean Contracts - A guide to writing clean code](https://www.wslyvh.com/clean-contracts/)
